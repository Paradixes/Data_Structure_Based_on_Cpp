# Data_structure_based_on_cpp
>This repository is for learning data structure based on cpp, so every program in it is basic.

## 1. Date Plus&Minus
>The program aims at doing date calculations,
>including:
>>1. a certain date add a number
>>2. a certain date minus a number
>>3. the number of days between two certain dates
>>4. the number of days between today and a certain day

>Relevant technologies
>>1. easy use of "class"
>>2. operator overloading
>>3. the use of "time" library
>>4. easy dictionary method
>>5. the use of julianday

## 2. Weekdays & Weekends
>The program aims at doing date calculations about weekdays and weekends,
>including:
>>1. the number of weekends between two certain dates
>>2. customize weekends and weekdays
>>3. output customized weekends between two certain dates

>Relevant technologies
>>1. the build of a one-way linked list
>>2. basic functions of a one-way linked list (locate, search, insert, remove, length)
>>3. the use of template

## 3. Josephus Problem
>The program aims at solving josephus problem

>Relevant technologies
>>1. the build of a double-linked circular list
>>2. basic functions of a double-linked circular list
(locate, search, insert, remove, length, move first node)

## 4. Explore Maze
>The program aims at running a maze through the data from a file

>Relevant technologies
>>1. the build of a stack
>>2. basic functions of a stack (top, push, pop)
>>3. use the stack_pop to explore the maze
>>4. the use of fstream

## 5. Print Management
>The program aims at simulating print course,
and the search function before printing

>Relevant technologies
>>1. the build of a priority queue
>>2. basic functions of a priority queue
(Dequeue, Enqueue, Locate)

## 6. 2D Array
>The program aims at analysing the data in a 2D Array

>Relevant technologies
>>1. use a 1D array to build a 2D Array
>>2. the use of "sort" in the "algorithm" library

## 7. Priority Calculator
>The program aims at calculate an expression with brackets,
>and the course of calculation will be given

>Relevant technologies
>>1. the use of string
>>2. the build of a generalized list
>>3. the change and search of the generalized list
>>4. the algorithm of the priority of operation

## 8. HuffmanTree Code
>The program aims at realizing easy compression based on huffman tree, 
>the frequency of a word and its code will be given

>Relevant technologies
>>1. the use of "map", "stack", "queue", "vector" and "fstream" library
>>2. the build of a binary tree
>>3. preorder traversal of the binary tree
